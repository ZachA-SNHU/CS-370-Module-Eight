    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    In this program, I was responsible for creating the features that the Agent used for chosoing between exploration, or exploitation. 
    This same loop also was the way that the Agent could effectively beginning learning from its previous experiences.
    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        Computer Scientists are responsible for creating, and maintaing ethical code that is used in every program ever made. From AI to MS Paint,
        Often times working in large groups of people in order to produce a product for a client.
        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        I approach a problem as a computer scientist, the same way that I did before studying computer science, by breaking down big problems into smaller steps, and then working through each of those steps.
        This allows me to accomplish the tasks needed to solve the big problem, by using methodical steps, that are easy to follow/understand.
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are mostly based on transparency. I say transparency because I need to be able to show that Im not giving the AI an implicit bias by giving it skewed data.
